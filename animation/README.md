### Animation - Make an animated scene
Please set the viewport as follows

```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> ```

You can use still images, if that is easier for you. But if you want to be more creative and learn about Sprite Sheets or working with Animated GIFs on a Canvas, this can be more challenging.
- Have a background.
    - Have talk bubbles appear for people/animals/vechicles to say things.
    - Change or reposition some items in your scene in different frames.  
- Make an animated scene lasting several seconds that repeats in an endless loop.
- Try to tell some sort of story.

To make things easier, have functions that move the various parts in your scene.

Might be useful to use JSON Array values to hold the positions/text/attributes of the items in your scene. And then go through a loop using those values to display the content.

Optional, more advanced features.
