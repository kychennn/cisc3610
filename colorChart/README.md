Color Chart Program

Store the following values in a JSON array in JavaScript.

Strawberry:15

Peach: 10

Banana:25

Pear: 10

Grape: 20

JSON in JavaScript example is best. Here it is partially, to help start you off.

```json
var fruit = [
	{name:"Strawberry", quantity:15, color:"red"},
	{name:"Peach", quantity:10, color:"orange"}
];
```

Using Javascript/Canvas, read in the JSON values, using a loop to draw out a bar chart showing the quantity in sales for the fruit. Each bar should be in a color that matches the fruit, please choose a unique color for each fruit.

Write the name of the fruit, followed by the bar chart. You can choose horizontal or vertical.
